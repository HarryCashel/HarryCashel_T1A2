# Harry Cashel - T1A2 - Portfolio

## Getting Started
Open the index.html file in Google Chrome.

## Prerequisites
None.

### Purpose
I created this website to showcase the skills I have learnt so far in CCC and market myself to employers.
It's a simple design that is consistent throughout the website. I will continue to update or even revamp it as I learn new skills and will personalise the information.

### Features
I tried to keep my first website as simple as possible using the
following features:
1. Media Queries
2. Box sizing
3. Flexbox
4. Webfonts
5. Gradients

Using these simple features I achieved a smooth and simple layout I'm proud of.
